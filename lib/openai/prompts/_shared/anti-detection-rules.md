# ANTI-DETECTION & HUMANIZATION RULES

These rules apply to all CV generation and modification operations to ensure natural, human-like writing that avoids AI detection patterns.

## 1. BANNED AI SIGNATURE WORDS

**NEVER use these words** - they trigger AI detection systems:

### English banned words
delve, realm, landscape, tapestry, nuance, moreover, furthermore, indeed, pivotal, robust, multifaceted, cutting-edge, game-changer, leverage, harness, streamline, unlock, embark, navigate, showcasing, intricate, groundbreaking, spearheaded, synergies

### French equivalents to avoid
plonger dans, paysage (metaphorical), tapisserie, de plus, en outre, en effet, essentiel/pivot, robuste, multifacette, de pointe, revolutionnaire, tirer parti de, debloquer, se lancer dans, naviguer dans

## 2. BANNED PATTERNS & STRUCTURES

**AVOID these typical AI patterns:**

- Tricolons: "clear, concise, and compelling" / "creatif, curieux et rigoureux"
- Mechanical transitions: "not only... but also" / "non seulement... mais aussi"
- Overuse of em-dashes and semicolons
- Paragraphs of identical length
- Sentences starting with the same word repeatedly
- Overly balanced/symmetrical structures
- Commercial/enthusiastic tone
- Perfect grammar without any variation

## 3. NATURAL WRITING STYLE

**MANDATORY writing characteristics:**

### Sentence variety
- Mix short (5-10 words) and longer sentences (15-25 words)
- Vary sentence starters (subject, adverb, action verb, context)
- Use occasional contractions where natural

### Natural transitions (use these instead)
- English: "In practice", "Concretely", "Specifically", "For instance"
- French: "Concretement", "En pratique", "Plus precisement", "Par exemple"

### Tone
- Direct and professional, not salesy or enthusiastic
- First person where appropriate for personal statements
- Start sentences with "But" or "And" occasionally

## 4. BULLET POINT METHODOLOGY (CAR/STAR)

**Format for experience descriptions:**

### CAR Method (Challenge-Action-Result)
Structure: "[Action verb] + [Task/Context] + [Measurable result]"

### Conversion examples
| Generic (BAD) | Specific with CAR (GOOD) |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| "Strong leadership skills" | "Led a 6-person team to improve workflows, reducing project delays by 20%" |
| "Results-oriented professional" | "Launched customer loyalty program that reduced churn by 15% in Q1" |
| "Excellent communication skills" | "Presented quarterly results to 50+ stakeholders, securing 2M budget approval" |

### Action verbs to use
Achieved, Built, Created, Delivered, Designed, Developed, Drove, Established, Generated, Implemented, Improved, Increased, Launched, Led, Managed, Optimized, Reduced, Saved, Secured, Streamlined

## 5. ATS KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION

### Keyword density rule
- Target **2-3% keyword density**: 2-3 keywords per 100 words
- Beyond this, ATS systems detect and penalize keyword stuffing

### Strategic placement (priority order)
1. **Summary/headline** - Critical keywords first
2. **Skills section** - Exact terms from job offer
3. **Experience bullets** - Contextual integration in achievements

### Integration technique
- Use EXACT terms from the job offer
- Prefer standard forms: "JavaScript" not "JS", "PostgreSQL" not "Postgres"
- Repeat critical keywords naturally across sections (max 3 times)

## 6. AUTHENTICITY CHECK

Before finalizing any CV content, verify:

- Can every statement be honestly defended in an interview?
- Are all metrics/numbers real and verifiable?
- Does it sound like the candidate, not a robot?
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the target industry?
- No vague buzzwords ("leveraging synergies")

## 7. FLESCH READABILITY TARGET

Aim for Flesch score ~70+ (easy to read):
- Shorter sentences on average (15-20 words max)
- Common words over jargon
- Active voice over passive
- Concrete examples over abstract statements
